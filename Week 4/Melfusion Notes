An important evaluation metric: as it relates to the project!!

- IMSM (image music similarity metric) 
- uses both the clip and clap score to gather image and audio embeddings to figure out the similarity between the audio and the image that has been produced.

Objective: MeLFusion is a diffusion model designed to synthesize music conditioned on both image and text inputs, addressing the limitation of previous models that focused solely on text for music generation.

Key Features:

Visual Synapse: A novel mechanism that infuses image semantics into the music generation process.
MeLBench Dataset: A new dataset containing 11,250 ⟨image, text, music⟩ triplets to facilitate research.
IMSM Metric: A new evaluation metric to measure the consistency between image-music pairs.
