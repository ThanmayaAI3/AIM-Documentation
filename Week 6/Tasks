Fix IMSM code to get lower values and test on the new updated code

Confusion is why the melfusion imsm code has two different tests and runs a normalization softmax on both of them
- take just their code and see if it works
- right now the only difference is that my code doesn't incorporate a softmax and it seems to take in two sets of data and computes every output

10/10/2024:
- IMSM code fixed!
- call with Chiho Notes:
  - 1. checking text relavance
  - 2. implement it so that it works with video (check possible length of video)
- Questions I still have:
  - Why does the melfusion code take 2 image, audio, text groups to run the code.
  - What part of the audio is being analyzed/ What is truncated/ What is tokenized for text
- Next Steps:
  - Check with the MelBench data set
  - Check with the MelBench output(Could be different than the MelBench dataset)

10/11/2024:
- Altered code to add clip and clap and also make it more readable
- Tested 2 examples from MelBench and got odd results
