Fix IMSM code to get lower values and test on the new updated code

Confusion is why the melfusion imsm code has two different tests and runs a normalization softmax on both of them
- take just their code and see if it works
- right now the only difference is that my code doesn't incorporate a softmax and it seems to take in two sets of data and computes every output
