1. Overview:
The paper introduces a method for generating spectrograms that can be interpreted as both natural images and natural sounds. This is achieved by combining text-to-image and text-to-spectrogram diffusion models. The resulting spectrograms are referred to as images that sound, as they retain visual structure while also translating into meaningful audio.

2. Problem Motivation:
Spectrograms are widely used in audio machine learning, translating sounds into visual forms. However, natural images do not directly translate into natural sounds.
Prior artistic approaches (like spectrogram art) embed images in sound, but typically result in poor audio quality.
The paper seeks to generate examples that lie at the intersection of visual and audio domains, producing spectrograms that make sense both visually and sonically.

3. Method:
Diffusion Models:
Diffusion models are generative models that learn by iteratively denoising data.
The authors combine Stable Diffusion (for image generation) and Auffusion (for audio/spectrogram generation), which share the same latent space.
By jointly denoising using both models, the process generates samples that are plausible under both visual and audio distributions.
Steps:
A noisy latent is passed through both models.
Noise estimates from the audio diffusion model and the image diffusion model are weighted and combined.
The process is repeated iteratively to achieve a clean latent that satisfies both audio and visual constraints.
Colorization:
After generating the grayscale spectrogram, the model can colorize it using a technique called Factorized Diffusion to create a visually appealing result.

4. Contributions:
Images that Sound: A type of multimodal generative art that is both a visual image and an audio sound.
Compositional Diffusion: The authors show how to combine pre-trained models from different modalities to produce multimodal outputs.
They also propose alternative methods for generating images that sound using score distillation sampling and imprint-based subtraction.

5. Quantitative & Qualitative Results:
Quantitative Evaluation:
Metrics such as CLIP (for image quality) and CLAP (for audio quality) are used to measure the alignment of generated outputs with the given text prompts.
Their method outperforms baselines like SDS and imprint techniques on both audio and visual quality.
Human Studies:
In a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) study, participants evaluated which samples better matched both the visual and audio prompts. The authors' method was chosen more frequently than the baseline models.
Qualitative Results:
The authors present several examples of their method successfully blending audio and visual cues, such as a castle paired with bell ringing or kittens paired with meowing.

6. Experiments:
Implementation Details:
Uses Stable Diffusion v1.5 for images and Auffusion for audio.
Warm-starting technique is used to balance between visual and audio priors during denoising.
Baselines:
SDS (Score Distillation Sampling): Tries to optimize both audio and visual objectives, but is computationally expensive and often fails to align both modalities.
Imprint: Subtracts a generated image from a spectrogram, but this results in low-quality audio.

7. Limitations:
The method cannot produce both high-fidelity audio and high-quality visuals simultaneously for all prompts.
The modelâ€™s performance is constrained by the quality of the audio diffusion model, which is not as advanced as the visual models.
Failure cases are observed with certain prompts, where the generated audio and visuals do not align well.

8. Future Directions:
Further exploration into multimodal art combining sound and images.
Potential applications in audio-visual learning, art, and audio steganography (hiding visual information within sound).

9. Societal Impact:
The method may be used for audio steganography, which could have implications in terms of misuse for embedding hidden images within audio for deceptive purposes.
Care should be taken in the deployment of these powerful generative models.

10. Conclusion:
The paper presents a method that, for the first time, generates spectrograms that function as both natural images and natural sounds. This is achieved through a novel combination of diffusion models across two modalities, expanding possibilities for artistic expression and cross-modal learning.
